# 🚀 Blockchain-Based Public Healthcare & Medical Records System

## 📌 Overview
This project leverages Solana blockchain technology to build a decentralized healthcare and medical records system. It aims to enhance healthcare infrastructure by securely storing patient records and improving accessibility to medical history.

---

## ❌ Problem Statement
1. **🏥 Poor Healthcare Infrastructure** – Many regions, particularly in developing countries, lack efficient systems for storing and managing patient records. Traditional methods are paper-based or siloed, leading to inefficiencies.
2. **📂 Lack of Patient Records** – Patients frequently visit multiple healthcare providers without a centralized medical history, resulting in fragmented and incomplete records.
3. **🔑 Difficulty in Accessing Medical History** – Patients may lose access to their records or struggle to transfer them between hospitals, leading to misdiagnoses and redundant tests.
4. **⚠️ Medical Errors & Data Tampering** – Missing or incorrect records contribute to improper treatment, while traditional record-keeping is vulnerable to manipulation and fraud.
5. **🌍 Remote Populations Affected** – Rural communities often lack access to centralized hospitals and require mobile health solutions that function even in low-connectivity areas.

## ✅ Solution: Blockchain-Based Health Records System
By utilizing blockchain technology, this system ensures secure, decentralized, and patient-controlled medical record management.

### 🔹 Key Features
1. **🔐 Decentralized & Secure Storage**
   - Records are stored across a decentralized network rather than a single hospital server.
   - Data is encrypted and can only be accessed by authorized parties, mitigating hacking risks.

2. **👤 Patient-Centered Access Control**
   - Patients own their health records and control access permissions for healthcare providers.
   - Using cryptographic keys, patients can selectively share data with doctors, pharmacies, or insurance providers.

3. **🔄 Interoperability Across Healthcare Providers**
   - Blockchain’s shared ledger enables different hospitals, clinics, and laboratories to access verified patient data in real time, eliminating redundancy.

4. **🚫 Prevention of Medical Errors & Fraud**
   - Immutable records ensure that medical data cannot be altered, reducing fraud and misdiagnosis.
   - Doctors have verified access to past prescriptions, allergies, and treatments, leading to more accurate diagnoses.

5. **💰 Smart Contracts for Insurance & Billing**
   - Automated smart contracts streamline insurance claims, reducing paperwork and fraud.
   - Patients receive transparent billing, improving trust in healthcare services.
